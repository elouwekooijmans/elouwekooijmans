Hi there, Iâ€™m Elena Louwe Kooijmans ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
ðŸ”­  I'm currently working on: <br>
A wealth management roboadvisor project that uses a predictive deep learning model to supply trading suggestions. <br><br>
ðŸŒ±  I'm currently learning: <br>
Dataset dimensionality reduction techniques in Python such as principal component analysis. <br><br>
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: <br>
Supervised machine learning techniques, such as recurrent neural network (RNN) development with time-series data. 

## My Skills
- Languages: Python, R, SQL/SQLite, C, Java, HTML, Powershell
- Frameworks: Keras, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Django, PyTorch
- Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Eclipse, RStudio, CUDA Toolkit, Git/Github, JIRA, Tableau, DBBrowser for SQLite 

## Current Interests
- Types of neural network architectures (transformers), parallel computing (CUDA), and advanced ML frameworks (PyTorch, Tensorflow).
- Embedded software systems, including their contribution towards the development of IoT devices and the critical role of Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS). 
- Analying the benefits of AI/ML implementation in finance, particularly in areas including price forecasting, FP&A, and alternative credit ratings.
- Cybersecurity, particularly focusing on the innovative application of blockchain networks towards cyber attack prevention.
- Big data storage solutions and their implications for the future, particularly focusing on cloud, relational (SQL), and non-relational databases.
